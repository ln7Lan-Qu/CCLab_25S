                <h3 class="red">Discovered by / at:</h3>
                <p>Prof.Lan, 2025</p>

                <h3 class="green">Family:</h3>
                <p>This creature is basically an insect. It doesn't belong to any distinct family, but it is a social species. When faced with danger, they gather together and form a flower-like shape to protect themselves from predators.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="right">
                <h3 class="green">Habitat:</h3>
                <p>A dark and damp environment, an abandoned garden, or a swamp during the rainy season.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Appearance:</h3>
                <p>This creature has a smooth, white, shell-like exoskeleton covering its front half, while its back half consists of a soft, fragile sac. The two parts are connected by grass-green segments. The sac is vibrant in color, dotted with bright red spots. The creature is incredibly small, with oval-shaped eyes positioned on top of its body. It also has four legs, which are cleverly hidden beneath its body.</p>

                <h3 class="green">Key Characteristics:</h3>

                    <li>Once mature, it lays a single egg.</li>
                    <li>The sac of this creature is very fragile.</li>

                <span class="yellow">What we know so far about [ DEWDAISY ]?</span>
                This creature is timid while smart. They protect themselves consciously -- see their disguising pattern and stress response!!! Also this creature is quite confusing -- people will gradually forget their noticing the existence of this small creature for no reason. Maybe the whole story is an illusion generated due to the terrible climate and annoying environment, who knows!
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> People can try touching the white body parts of this small creature to observe its movement trajectory changes. But be careful, because their pouches are very fragile, and even a slight touch can lead to death!!! People can also feed dewdaisy's egg water to make it grow and mature. People can also use flashlights to illuminate dewdaisy and observe their body details.
